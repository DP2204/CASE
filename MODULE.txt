During my internship at GM IT APS, I worked on the Picasso application, which was deployed on a WebLogic server. Initially, the deployment process for the WAR file was completely manual, involving multiple steps that had to be performed carefully in a specific order.

The process began with accessing the WebLogic console through CyberArk for secure login. Before deploying a new WAR file, we first had to stop all the slave nodes from the server to avoid any conflicts during deployment. Once the environment was prepared, we navigated to the WebLogic Administration Console, clicked on “Lock and Edit”, and proceeded to the Deployments section. From there, we selected the Install option, uploaded the latest WAR file, and installed it as an application.

After installation, it was necessary to target the deployment to the correct cluster, activate the changes, and then start all the WebLogic nodes again. Finally, we would verify if the application started successfully and was accessible. This entire manual procedure was time-consuming and prone to human errors, especially during frequent deployments.

To overcome these challenges, we worked on automating the deployment process using Jenkins and Ansible. We created Ansible roles and tasks to handle steps such as stopping and starting nodes, uploading the WAR file, deploying it to the correct cluster, and verifying the deployment status. A Jenkins pipeline was then designed to orchestrate this automation — integrating with Ansible to execute tasks sequentially and ensure a smooth deployment flow.
This automation not only reduced deployment time significantly but also minimized manual intervention and errors, making the overall process more reliable and efficient. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with DevOps tools like Jenkins and Ansible, and also developed a strong understanding of WebLogic server management and CI/CD pipeline implementation.

During my internship, my primary contribution was on the Track and Trace functionality of the Conserto application — a feature designed to provide visibility and traceability of trade events across different stages. I worked on enhancing the automation logic, ensuring that each event and its status could be accurately tracked within the workflow.

To achieve this, I implemented the Auto IS mapping logic, which automatically links internal statuses between systems, reducing manual intervention and improving data consistency. This involved understanding complex trade event lifecycles, working closely with both the backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (Angular), and ensuring seamless integration within Conserto’s existing workflow.



One of the major highlights of my internship journey was the Leaders Connect sessions — moments where learning went beyond slides and turned into meaningful conversations with senior leaders of the organization. Each session offered valuable insights into leadership, innovation, and growth, giving us a glimpse of how strategic decisions are made and how technology continues to drive transformation across the company. Another memorable experience was the Speed Meet, where we got the opportunity to interact with eight leaders, each for ten minutes. It was my first time attending such a session, and it turned out to be one of the most engaging and inspiring parts of the internship. The format encouraged open conversations and quick yet impactful exchanges, allowing us to learn from each leader’s journey in a unique way. During this session, Baig Mirza Abid shared a piece of advice that truly stayed with me. He said, “The first two to three years are all about hard work. Don’t divert yourself — focus on one thing and become an expert at it.” That line really hit me, because it perfectly captured what the early years of our career should be about — staying focused, building expertise, and laying a strong foundation for long-term growth




I’ll be honest — I walked into the hackathon both nervous and excited. Nervous because I had no idea what exactly we were going to build, and excited because it was our first 24 hours in the company — with good food, fun games, and of course, free Wi-Fi! 😄 But it wasn’t only about coding — the organizers even arranged games and stand-up comedy sessions, which added so much freshness and energy. What made it even more interesting was working with a completely new group of people — folks I had never met before. Soon, strangers became teammates, we divided the work, ideas started flowing, and the real hackathon spirit kicked in — creativity, caffeine, and chaos. Truly, an unforgettable experience!


Moving from campus to corporate felt like stepping into a whole new world. In college, we chased grades and deadlines; in the corporate world, we chase results and growth. The first few weeks were a mix of excitement and confusion — new tools, new faces, and endless meetings! Back in college, we used to study only at the end — just before exams. But here, every day feels like a new exam — with new tasks, new learning, and new challenges.

What really helped was how the organizers arranged various training sessions. They set a perfect roadmap that guided us from academic habits to professional skills. In campus, we focused on projects, assignments, and attendance; but in corporate, it’s about structure, ownership, and confidence — something that builds day by day. The sessions were practical, interactive, and gave us a new mindset — one that truly fits the professional world. Slowly, I realized this journey isn’t about leaving college behind; it’s about continuing to learn — just with ID cards instead of admit cards.




My role right now is as a Full Stack Developer — working with Java and Angular. In the beginning, I was assigned a small task that involved the team’s entire tech stack. Coming from a Python background, I had to learn everything from scratch. I spent extra hours exploring, trying, failing, and learning — and that’s when I realized growth here is like climbing a mountain. And honestly, I’m still on that trek!

Team learning and setting up wasn’t easy for me at first. But the environment that my team and the organization created was so warm and supportive that anyone could easily adapt and start learning. Every day brings a new step, a new view, and a new challenge. I’ve learned that learning never stops — never ever stops — it just changes direction every day. But no matter where it turns, you just keep climbing.




This has been one of the most important parts of my journey — the constant support from our managers and mentors. They always kept us engaged and made sure no one ever felt left out, whether in the team or in the workspace. The training sessions they planned were not just helpful, but truly well-structured and interactive. Because of them, fun and work both stayed perfectly balanced.

Our daily calls helped us stay on track and see how we were progressing with our tasks. What I really appreciate is how approachable they’ve always been — whether it’s a technical doubt, a project challenge, or even something personal, they’re always ready to guide us. Their support made this learning journey smoother, motivating, and full of confidence.
